# Quick Test Environment

The procedures mentioned here are meant to quickly spin up a external database for verification and feature demostration of Synchdb. The necessary files and scripts for starting sample heterogeneous databases can be found at SynchDB repository [here](https://github.com/Hornetlabs/synchdb/testenv/)

## **Prepare a Sample MySQL Database**

We can start a sample MySQL database for testing using docker compose. The user credentials are described in the `synchdb-mysql-test.yaml` file
```
docker compose -f synchdb-mysql-test.yaml up -d
```

Login to MySQL as `root` and grant permissions to user `mysqluser` to perform real-time CDC
```sql
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p

GRANT replication client on *.* to mysqluser;
GRANT replication slave  on *.* to mysqluser;
GRANT RELOAD ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Exit mysql client tool:
```
\q
```

## **Prepare a Sample SQL Server Database**

We can start a sample SQL Server database for testing using docker compose. The user credentials are described in the `synchdb-sqlserver-test.yaml` file
```
docker compose -f synchdb-sqlserver-test.yaml up -d
```
use synchdb-sqlserver-withssl-test.yaml file for the SQL Server with SSL certificate enabled.

You may not have SQL Server client tool installed, you could login to SQL Server container to access its client tool.

Find out the container ID for SQL server:
```
id=$(docker ps | grep sqlserver | awk '{print $1}')
```

Copy the database schema into SQL Server container:
```
docker cp inventory.sql $id:/
```

Log in to SQL Server container:
```
docker exec -it $id bash
```

Build the database according to the schema:
```
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -U sa -P $SA_PASSWORD -i /inventory.sql
```

Run some simple queries (add -N -C if you are using SSL enabled SQL Server):
```
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -U sa -P $SA_PASSWORD -d testDB -Q "insert into orders(order_date, purchaser, quantity, product_id) values( '2024-01-01', 1003, 2, 107)"

/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -U sa -P $SA_PASSWORD -d testDB -Q "select * from orders"
```

## **Prepare a Sample Oracle Database**

We can use the free Oracle database docker image provided by Oracle for testing and evaluation of SynchDB. It comes with a free container database `FREE` and a pluggable database `FREEPDB1`
```
docker run -d -p 1521:1521 container-registry.oracle.com/database/free:latest
```

Find out the container ID and login to it:
```
id=$(docker ps | grep oracle | awk '{print $1}')
docker exec -it $id bash
```

Follow the procedure described [here](user-guide/remote_database_setups/) to set up logminer and logminer user


## **Use CI Script to Prepare Test Databases**

Example MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle databases can also be prepared using a script, located in `ci/` folder under the source repository. The script requires docker and docker-compose to run and basically follow the same procedures as described above.

Prepare MySQL database for test:
```
DBTYPE=mysql ci/setup-remotedbs.sh

```

Prepare SQL Server database for test:
```
DBTYPE=sqlserver ci/setup-remotedbs.sh

```

Prepare Oracle23ai database for test:
```
DBTYPE=oracle ci/setup-remotedbs.sh

```

Prepare Oracle19c database for test:
```
DBTYPE=ora19c ci/setup-remotedbs.sh

```

Prepare Oracle19c database with Openlog Replicator for test:
```
DBTYPE=olr OLRVER=1.3.0 ci/setup-remotedbs.sh

```
