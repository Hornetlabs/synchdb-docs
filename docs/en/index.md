SynchDB is a PostgreSQL extension for synchronizing data from different database sources.

## Introduction

SynchDB is a PostgreSQL extension designed to replicate data from one or more heterogeneous databases (such as MySQL, MS SQLServer, Oracle, etc.) directly to PostgreSQL in a fast and reliable way. PostgreSQL serves as the destination from multiple heterogeneous database sources. No middleware or third-party software is required to orchestrate the data synchronization between heterogeneous databases and PostgreSQL. SynchDB extension itself is capable of handling all the data synchronization needs.

## Features

- Efficient data synchronization
- Support for multiple database sources
- Flexible data transformation rules
- Easy integration with existing PostgreSQL databases
